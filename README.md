Real-time Object Detection with YOLO and Streamlit

https://realtimeobjectdetectionml.streamlit.app/

This project showcases a real-time object detection application utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, integrated with a streamlined interface powered by Streamlit. YOLO is renowned for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks, making it a popular choice for various computer vision applications.

Key Features

Real-time Detection: Capable of detecting objects in both static images and live webcam feeds.
High Accuracy: Employs the pre-trained YOLOv3 model for precise object detection.
User-friendly Interface: Designed with Streamlit to provide an intuitive and interactive web-based user experience.
Dynamic Model Loading: Automatically downloads required model files if not available locally, ensuring ease of setup.
